# Embeddable Vue JS Component

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Design choices
I decided to use Vue.js to display GitHub API profile data.  I also
chose Bootstrap 4 for my CSS framework because of its ease to use and 
visual appeal.

### Ideas for future development
Ideas I have for further features include: configurability of size
and CSS.
